## [0.4.0] - 2020-10-09

**BREAKING CHANGES**

1. The [configuration syntax](./docs/configuration_syntax.md) has been restructured quite a bit and some runtime flags have been moved in it as well. Refer to the updated documentation to check what you may need to update.

2. Some metrics have been renamed:

| Original metric name | New metric name|
|---|---|
|*gitlab_ci_pipeline_last_job_run_artifact_size*|`gitlab_ci_pipeline_job_artifact_size_bytes`|
|*gitlab_ci_pipeline_last_job_run_artifact_size*|`gitlab_ci_pipeline_job_artifact_size_bytes`|
|*gitlab_ci_pipeline_last_job_run_duration_seconds*|`gitlab_ci_pipeline_job_duration_seconds`|
|*gitlab_ci_pipeline_last_job_run_id*|`gitlab_ci_pipeline_job_id`|
|*gitlab_ci_pipeline_last_job_run_status*|`gitlab_ci_pipeline_job_status`|
|*gitlab_ci_pipeline_last_run_duration_seconds*|`gitlab_ci_pipeline_duration_seconds`|
|*gitlab_ci_pipeline_last_run_id*|`gitlab_ci_pipeline_id`|
|*gitlab_ci_pipeline_last_run_status*|`gitlab_ci_pipeline_status`|
|*gitlab_ci_pipeline_time_since_last_job_run_seconds*|`gitlab_ci_pipeline_job_timestamp`|
|*gitlab_ci_pipeline_time_since_last_run_seconds*|`gitlab_ci_pipeline_timestamp`|

3. On top of being renamed, the `.*time_since.*` metrics have been also converted to timestamps.
You will need to update your PromQL queries to leverage the new format. eg: `time() - gitlab_ci_pipeline_timestamp`

4. We now output sparse status metrics by default, if you want to revert to the default behaviour you will need to add this
statement to your config file:

```yaml
defaults:
  output_sparse_status_metrics: false
```

## [0.3.0] - 2020-04-29

### **BREAKING CHANGES**

- `default_refs` & `refs` parameter have been renamed respectively to `default_refs_regexp` and `refs_regexp` to make them more explicit
- In the config, there is a new `defaults` parameter group for any setting which can be overridden at the `project` or `wildcard` level. It includes the following parameters:
  - **fetch_pipeline_job_metrics**
  - **fetch_pipeline_variables**
  - **output_sparse_status_metrics**

- Configuration for OpenMetrics Encoding in metrics HTTP endpoint. Enabled by default but can be disable using `disable_openmetrics_encoding: true`

- Augmented `disable_tls_verify` with `disable_health_check` additional parameter to drive the behaviour of checking healthiness of target service 
- Reading pipeline variables if enabled setting `fetch_pipeline_variables` to `true` (defaults to `false`)
- Pipeline variables can be filtered with `pipeline_variables_filter_regex` (defaults to `.*`)
- Configurable ServiceMonitor resource through the helm chart
