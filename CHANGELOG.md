## [0.3.0] - 2020-04-29

### **BREAKING CHANGES**

- `default_refs` & `refs` parameter have been renamed respectively to `default_refs_regexp` and `refs_regexp` to make them more explicit
- In the config, there is a new `defaults` parameter group for any setting which can be overridden at the `project` or `wildcard` level. It includes the following parameters:
  - **fetch_pipeline_job_metrics**
  - **fetch_pipeline_variables**
  - **output_sparse_status_metrics**
  - **pipeline_variables_filter_regex**
  - **refs_regexp**
- Renamed the following parameters (their behaviour remains the same):
  - `projects_polling_interval_seconds` into `wildcards_projects_discover_interval_seconds`
  - `refs_polling_interval_seconds` into `projects_refs_discover_interval_seconds`
  - `pipelines_polling_interval_seconds` into `projects_refs_polling_interval_seconds`

### Added

- `kind` label on all metrics which reflects the type of the ref : branch, tag or merge-request
- project/wildcard parameters `fetch_merge_request_pipelines_refs` and `fetch_merge_request_pipelines_refs_init_limit` to enable the metrics polling of merge requests pipelines
- Configuration for OpenMetrics Encoding in metrics HTTP endpoint. Enabled by default but can be disable using `disable_openmetrics_encoding: true`
- Worker pool for projects polling: set `maximum_projects_poller_workers` with an integer value to control parallelism (defaults to `runtime.GOMAXPROCS(0)`)  
- Augmented `disable_tls_verify` with `disable_health_check` additional parameter to drive the behaviour of checking healthiness of target service 
- Reading pipeline variables if enabled setting `fetch_pipeline_variables` to `true` (defaults to `false`)
- Pipeline variables can be filtered with `pipeline_variables_filter_regex` (defaults to `.*`)
- Configurable ServiceMonitor resource through the helm chart

### Changed

- Projects polling from GitLab API is done in parallel using `maximum_projects_poller_workers` pollers and concurrently fetching refs and projects
- Fixed a bug causing duplicate metrics when status changes with sparse flag enabled
- Updated labels syntax in helm chart to comply with standards
- Updated logging, using more extensively the log.WithFields parameter for an enhanced troubleshooting experience
- Bumped prometheus/client_golang to `1.6`

## [0.2.14] - 2020-04-09

### Added

- Support for pipelines status : `manual`

### Changed

- Bumped **go-gitlab** to `v0.31.0` which includes an exponentional backoff retry mechanism on API errors
- Renamed the `job` label into `job_name`
- Fixed a bug in the helm deployment when using service labels

## [0.2.13] - 2020-03-27

### Added

- **new** `fetch_pipeline_job_metrics` configuration flag (default `false`).
When enabled, various statistics for the jobs from the last pipeline run will be collected.

- **new** `output_sparse_status_metrics` flag (default `false`).
When enabled, only reports the status metric currently matching the last pipeline run.
Reduces reported metric count, at the cost of status values being expired from storage
if not seen in a long time.
