## [v0.5.0] - 2021-06-02

**BREAKING CHANGES**

- The configuration syntax has evolved, you can refer to the [updated version of the doc](docs/configuration_syntax.md)
  - `pull.maximum_gitlab_api_requests_per_second` has moved to `gitlab.maximum_requests_per_second`
  - `project_defaults.pull.refs.*` has been redone in a hopefully more comprehensible fashion
    - `project_defaults.pull.refs.(branches|tags|merge_requests).*` parameters can now be used to have a finer granularity
      on the management of per-ref-kind settings
    - `project_defaults.pull.refs.from.(pipelines|merge_requests)` is not natively managed as part of the per-ref-kind specific parameters
  - `project_defaults.pull.environments.name_regexp` has moved to `project_defaults.pull.environments.regexp`
  - `project_defaults.pull.environments.tags_regexp` was removed to avoid confusion

- Logging configuration now has to be done as part of the config file instead of CLI flags: 

```yaml
log:
  level: info
  format: text
```

- By default, when exporting metrics for `environments`, stopped ones will not be considered any more.

### Added

- New metric `gitlab_ci_pipeline_queued_duration_seconds`
- New metric `gitlab_ci_pipeline_job_queued_duration_seconds`

## [0.4.0] - 2020-10-09

**BREAKING CHANGES**

1. The [configuration syntax](./docs/configuration_syntax.md) has been restructured quite a bit and some runtime flags have been moved in it as well. Refer to the updated documentation to check what you may need to update.

2. Some metrics have been renamed:

| Original metric name | New metric name|
|---|---|
|*gitlab_ci_pipeline_last_job_run_artifact_size*|`gitlab_ci_pipeline_job_artifact_size_bytes`|
|*gitlab_ci_pipeline_last_job_run_artifact_size*|`gitlab_ci_pipeline_job_artifact_size_bytes`|
|*gitlab_ci_pipeline_last_job_run_duration_seconds*|`gitlab_ci_pipeline_job_duration_seconds`|
|*gitlab_ci_pipeline_last_job_run_id*|`gitlab_ci_pipeline_job_id`|
|*gitlab_ci_pipeline_last_job_run_status*|`gitlab_ci_pipeline_job_status`|
|*gitlab_ci_pipeline_last_run_duration_seconds*|`gitlab_ci_pipeline_duration_seconds`|
|*gitlab_ci_pipeline_last_run_id*|`gitlab_ci_pipeline_id`|
|*gitlab_ci_pipeline_last_run_status*|`gitlab_ci_pipeline_status`|
|*gitlab_ci_pipeline_time_since_last_job_run_seconds*|`gitlab_ci_pipeline_job_timestamp`|
|*gitlab_ci_pipeline_time_since_last_run_seconds*|`gitlab_ci_pipeline_timestamp`|

3. On top of being renamed, the `.*time_since.*` metrics have been also converted to timestamps.
You will need to update your PromQL queries to leverage the new format. eg: `time() - gitlab_ci_pipeline_timestamp`

4. We now output sparse status metrics by default, if you want to revert to the default behaviour you will need to add this
statement to your config file:

```yaml
defaults:
  output_sparse_status_metrics: false
```

- In the config, there is a new `defaults` parameter group for any setting which can be overridden at the `project` or `wildcard` level. It includes the following parameters:

  - **fetch_pipeline_variables**
  - **output_sparse_status_metrics**

- Reading pipeline variables if enabled setting `fetch_pipeline_variables` to `true` (defaults to `false`)
- Pipeline variables can be filtered with `pipeline_variables_filter_regex` (defaults to `.*`)
- Configurable ServiceMonitor resource through the helm chart
