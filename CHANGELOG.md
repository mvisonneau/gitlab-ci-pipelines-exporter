## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Configuration for OpenMetrics Encoding in metrics HTTP endpoint: `prometheus_openmetrics_encoding` can be set `true` or `false` (default)
- Worker pool for projects polling: set `maximum_projects_poller_workers` with an integer value to control parallelism (defaults to `runtime.GOMAXPROCS(0)`)  

### Changed

- Projects polling from GitLab API is done in parallel using `maximum_projects_poller_workers` pollers and concurrently fetching refs and projects
- Fixed a bug causing duplicate metrics when status changes with sparse flag enabled

## [0.2.14] - 2019-04-09

### Added

- Support for pipelines status : `manual`

### Changed

- Bumped **go-gitlab** to `v0.31.0` which includes an exponentional backoff retry mechanism on API errors
- Renamed the `job` label into `job_name`
- Fixed a bug in the helm deployment when using service labels

## [0.2.13] - 2019-03-27

### Added

- **new** `fetch_pipeline_job_metrics` configuration flag (default `false`).
When enabled, various statistics for the jobs from the last pipeline run will be collected.

- **new** `output_sparse_status_metrics` flag (default `false`).
When enabled, only reports the status metric currently matching the last pipeline run.
Reduces reported metric count, at the cost of status values being expired from storage
if not seen in a long time.
